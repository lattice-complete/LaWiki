    "_Proof._ The proof is by the pigeonhole principle. There are more than $\\left(q^{n /(n+m)}\\right)^{n+m}=q^n$ vectors in $\\mathbb{Z}^{n+m}$ whose coefficients are between 0 and $q^{n /(n+m)}$. Since there are only $q^n$ possibilities for the value of $\\mathbf{A z}$ mod $q$, there must exist two distinct $\\mathbf{z}_1, \\mathbf{z}_2$ with coefficients in the aforementioned range such that $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{z}_1 \\equiv \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{z}_2(\\bmod q)$. Thus $\\mathbf{z}_1-\\mathbf{z}_2 \\in\\left[q^{n /(n+m)}\\right]^{n+m}$ and $\\mathbf{A}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_1-\\mathbf{z}_2\\right) \\equiv \\mathbf{0}(\\bmod q)$."

    "The problem does get easier as $\\beta$ increases. Clearly if $\\beta=q / 2$, then the problem is trivially solved by just setting the coefficients of $\\mathbf{z}$ that are being multiplied by $\\mathbf{I}_n$ to the target coefficients. For smaller value of $\\beta$, one would run an algorithm that finds a vector in the lattice that is some factor larger than the smallest vector. All modern efficient (i.e. polynomial-time) algorithms for finding such short vectors are descendants of the famous LLL algorithm {cite:p}`LLL` which guarantees to find a vector of length at most $2^{O(n+m)}$ times larger than that of the shortest vector in the lattice. Lemma 4 then implies that for a random $\\mathbf{A}$, the LLL algorithm will find a vector $\\mathbf{z} \\in\\left[2^{\\Omega(n+m)} \\cdot q^{n /(n+m)}\\right]^{n+m}$ in $\\mathcal{L}_q^{\\perp}\\left(\\left[\\mathbf{A} \\mid \\mathbf{I}_n\\right]\\right)$.\n",
