abstract = {We introduce HyperNova, a new recursive argument for proving incremental computations whose steps are expressed with CCS&nbsp;(Setty et al. ePrint 2023/552), a customizable constraint system that simultaneously generalizes Plonkish, R1CS, and AIR without overheads. HyperNova makes four contributions, each resolving a major problem in the area of recursive arguments.First, it provides a folding scheme for CCS where the prover’s cryptographic cost is a single multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) of size equal to the number of variables in the constraint system, which is optimal when using an MSM-based commitment scheme. The folding scheme can fold multiple instances at once, making it easier to build generalizations of IVC such as PCD. Second, when proving program executions on stateful machines (e.g., EVM, RISC-V), the cost of proving a step of a program is proportional only to the size of the circuit representing the instruction invoked by the program step (“a la carte” cost profile). Third, we show how to achieve zero-knowledge for “free” and without the need to employ zero-knowledge SNARKs: we use a folding scheme to “randomize” IVC proofs. This highlights a new application of folding schemes. Fourth, we show how to efficiently instantiate HyperNova over a cycle of elliptic curves. For this, we provide a general technique, which we refer to as CycleFold, that applies to all modern folding-scheme-based recursive arguments.},

Our construction is based on the Module-LWE assumption and achieves proof sizes that are logarithmic in the size of the constraint system. The scheme supports arbitrary fields, including small characteristic fields, and provides concrete efficiency improvements over existing lattice-based approaches. In particular, LaBRADOR enables efficient batching of multiple R1CS instances and supports fast parallel verification.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose Greyhound, the first concretely efficient polynomial commitment scheme from standard lattice assumptions. At the core of our construction lies a simple three-round protocol for proving evaluations for polynomials of bounded degree N with verifier time complexity O(N). By composing it with the LaBRADOR proof system (CRYPTO 2023), we obtain a succinct proof of polynomial evaluation (i.e. polylogarithmic in N) that admits a sublinear verifier runtime. To highlight practicality of Greyhound, we provide implementation details including concrete sizes and runtimes. Notably, for large polynomials of degree at most N=230, the scheme produces evaluation proofs of size 53KB, which is more than 104 times smaller than the recent lattice-based framework, called SLAP (EUROCRYPT 2024), and around three orders of magnitude smaller than Ligero (CCS 2017) and Brakedown (CRYPTO 2023).},
